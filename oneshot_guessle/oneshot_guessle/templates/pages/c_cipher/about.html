<p>
    The Crescent Cipher is an homage to the brilliant puzzles offered by adventofcode.com.
    <br>
    For those unfamiliar, Advent of Code is an annual event where participants solve a series of programming puzzles during the month of December.
    <br>
    My aim is to create a similar experience, but with a focus on the annual event being the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
    <br>
    while, each day during Ramadan, a new puzzle will be released, the aim is to keep the challenges simple enough that they are not too taxing for those
    who may be fasting during the day.
    <br>
    The puzzles can be solved using any programming language, and I should be beginner friendly.
    You only really need basic programming knowledge to get started.

    <br>
    There will be puzzles for the first 20 days of Ramadan. The last 10 days will not include any puzzles, as I want to give participants time to focus on their spiritual practices during this important period.
    
    <br>
    I hope you enjoy solving these puzzles as much as I enjoyed creating them!
